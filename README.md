Grains of salt and pepper are placed on a plate $${\color{yellow} \\{ }$$
<br>
  &emsp;As the plate moves $${\color{blue} \\{ }$$
  <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;they form an elliptical shape
    <br>
  &emsp; $${\color{blue} \\} }$$,
  <br>
  &emsp;Our eyes cannot fully track their speed $${\color{blue} \\{ }$$
  <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;leaving us unable to focus
    <br>
  &emsp; $${\color{blue} \\} }$$
  <br>
$${\color{yellow} \\} }$$
<br>
These trajectories and the resulting blur highlight $${\color{blue} \( }$$ the limits of our visual resolution $${\color{blue} \) }$$
